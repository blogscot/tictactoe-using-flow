# Using Flow Types

This example application is an implementation of the Medium blog series, [Back to Basics: Using React + Flow][1], by `A. Sharif`.

The Flow Types using in the application can be found in: _src/flow-typed/_ which contains types for Jasmine tests I wrote. The internally defined Flow types can be found in _src/Declarations/flowTypes.js_.

## Run the Project

First install the project dependencies using either _npm_ or _yarn_:

```bash
 npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

then use the _start_ script to run the application:

```bash
npm run start
```

or

```bash
yarn  run start
```
